-- Adds `avatar` to get_public_profile so other members see a profile's photo
-- (set on the profile page). The photo is stored in user_goals('client_identity')
-- .photo (a small resized data URL). Gated on can_view like the other details, so
-- a private/non-friend viewer still only sees name + tier + initials.
--
-- Supersedes 2026-06-07-public-profile-friends-visibility.sql (adds one column).
-- Idempotent; safe to re-run.
