-- Make the profile `avatar` (photo) ALWAYS visible — even for private / non-
-- friend profiles — alongside name + tier + initials. Only bio/pronouns/goal/
-- link stay gated on can_view. (Per product: everyone should see the avatar a
-- member chose, whether it's a picture or their initials.)

-- Supersedes 2026-06-07-public-profile-avatar.sql (same shape; avatar ungated).
-- Idempotent; safe to re-run.
