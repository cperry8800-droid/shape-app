# Shape — the working notes as they stood on 2026-10-16

Everything in `docs/WORKLOG.md` above its changelog on 2026-10-16, the day the
changelog was retired, byte-identical below the rule: the full "How we work"
section with every reviewer ruling and correction, the architecture map, the
backend touchpoints and the old open-work list. The changelog entries themselves
went to [`WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-2026-10.md`](WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-2026-10.md).

# Shape — working notes & changelog

Running memory for ongoing work on the Shape app. Skim this before starting
mobile/website work so context carries across sessions. Add a dated entry to the
changelog whenever something ships.

## How we work

- **No colored emoji for NEW additions going forward.** Any emoji you *add* from
  now on should be monochrome — use typographic symbols (⚙ ↗ ✓ → × ♡ ＋ #) or
  theme-tinted inline SVG/icons, matching the editorial aesthetic. **Do NOT
  retroactively change existing emoji or colors** already in the app/website
  (especially on profiles) — leave current ones as-is. Rule applies to new emoji
  only.
- **The changelog entry comes AFTER the PR, not before — owner, 2026-09-11:** *"new rule, do
  worklog after PR is completed"*. Write the dated entry once the PR is done, so it can record
  what the review round actually found and what the final head actually was. ⚠ **THE REASON IS
  MEASURED, ON THE PR THAT PROMPTED THE RULING.** #2053's entry was written before its review
  round and said the fix was verified and complete; CodeRabbit then found a **P1 the entry had
  no way to know about** — the timezone fix was correct everywhere a member LOOKED and still
  wrong where the booking was STORED. An entry written early is not merely incomplete, it is a
  **false claim in a file every session auto-loads**: the next reader would have believed the
  write path was always right. Keep the *verification* numbers for last too — a suite count
  from before the review round is a count for a tree that no longer exists.
- **Migrations: just post the raw GitHub SQL link.** When a migration is
  created, reply with only the `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../supabase-migrations/<file>.sql`
  link — the user runs it on Supabase. Don't paste the SQL body or long explanations.
- ⛔️ **NEVER edit on a stale base — verify FIRST, every session/turn.** The web
  container periodically re-clones/resets the working tree to an *older* commit
  while `origin/main` holds the real latest. Editing on that stale base creates
  duplicate commits, rebase conflicts, and lost work — it has cost real tokens
  multiple times. **Before making ANY edit:** run
  `git fetch origin main && git rev-parse HEAD origin/main` — if HEAD ≠
  origin/main, run `git reset --hard origin/main` first.
  ⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-09-01 — this bullet prescribed `rev-parse --short HEAD
  origin/main`, WHICH FAILS** (`fatal: Needed a single revision`, exit 128): with
  two revisions `--short` is the part that breaks, not the pair, so dropping it
  makes the one-liner work (`--short` each ref separately if you want the
  abbreviation). **The correction is at the source this time.** Three separate
  handoffs — `HANDOFF-2026-06-16.md`, `-08-29`, `-08-31` — had each independently
  recorded the failure and told the reader to run the two refs separately, while
  the file EVERY session auto-loads went on prescribing the broken command. *A fix
  written only where nobody auto-reads it is not a fix* — and the three of them all
  diagnosed it as the two-ref form rather than `--short`, so the sharper answer had
  to be re-derived a fourth time to be found. `main` and the session's
  dev branch (the current `claude/*` working branch — it differs per session) are
  always kept identical (push both to the same commit); treat `origin/main` as the
  single source of truth.
- **Session handoffs → `docs/HANDOFF-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.** Longer-form end-of-session
  handoffs (state snapshot · what shipped · architecture you'll need · open
  follow-ups) live as their own dated file in `docs/`, separate from this
  changelog. **At session start, read the newest `docs/HANDOFF-*.md`**
  (`ls docs/HANDOFF-*.md | sort -r | head -1`) alongside this WORKLOG — standalone
  docs are NOT auto-loaded into context, so this pointer is how they get found. When
  you write one, keep the short shipped-summary as a dated entry in this file's
  changelog too, and name the handoff file so it sorts by date.
  ⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-09-01 — this bullet prescribed `ls -t docs/HANDOFF-*.md | head -1`,
  WHICH NAMES THE WRONG FILE.** `ls -t` sorts by MTIME, and mtime is re-stamped by any
  checkout, branch switch or edit, so it reorders files whose names say otherwise. It is
  worst in the **web container**, where the repo is cloned fresh and EVERY file carries an
  identical checkout mtime — the order is then arbitrary, not merely skewed. Measured this
  session it returned `HANDOFF-2026-08-29.md`: **three handoffs stale**, i.e. the
  pre-i18n-wave state. The filenames are zero-padded ISO dates *precisely so* a lexical
  sort works, which is what the very next clause of this bullet tells you to preserve —
  the convention was already right, only the command was wrong. **The correction is at
  the source this time.** `GO-LIVE-CHECKLIST.md` had recorded this defect in full,
  including the line *"`docs/WORKLOG.md` documents the `ls -t` form and has the same
  defect"* — and the fix was never carried to the file every session auto-loads. *A fix
  written only where nobody auto-reads it is not a fix* — the same sentence the stale-base
  bullet above had to pay for, in the same section, two days later. Spelled identically in
  both files so a third form cannot drift in.
- **Generated media (Higgsfield) → the Sources table in
  [`marketing/shape-radio-launch-cut.md`](../marketing/shape-radio-launch-cut.md).** Every
  clip and track the marketing work has ever generated is listed there by **job id +
  filename + verbatim prompt + the submitted params**, marked current vs superseded. ⚠ **A
  generation is reproducible only if the prompt is written down beside the file id** — the
  v6 video prompts were NOT, and cannot be recovered; the tracks were, and can be re-made.
  So: never re-generate a clip you already have, and never fetch a superseded id (the
  original Scene A is the naked runner owner note 6 exists to replace). Re-verify what is
  still live with `mcp__Higgsfield__show_generation_by_ids`; the cloudfront prefix is in
  the table. **The web container's proxy DENIES that cloudfront host**, so media cannot be
  downloaded here at all — fetching, rendering and md5-verifying happen in the Higgsfield
  sandbox (`sandbox_exec`), which is also the only place `ffmpeg`/`PIL` exist.
- **This file is SIZE-CAPPED: the newest ~10 changelog entries live here, everything
  older is in dated archives.** `AGENTS.md` `@`-imports this file, so *every session
  pays its whole size before the first prompt*. `tests/worklog-size.test.mjs` fails
  the suite past **15 entries or 256 KB**; the remedy is
  **`node scripts/worklog-archive.mjs`**, which moves the oldest entries into
  `WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-<YYYY-MM>.md` by each entry's own month, **byte-identical**, and
  leaves the newest 10 live. Run it in the same PR as the entry that tripped the
  test; a new archive file must be added to the list below (the test says so).
  The archives are **linked, never `@`-imported**:
  [`WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-2026-10.md`](WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-2026-10.md) (October, still open —
  the script appends to it) ·
  [`WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-2026-09.md`](WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-2026-09.md) (118 entries) ·
  [`WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-2026-08.md`](WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-2026-08.md) (90 entries) ·
  [`WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-2026-06-07.md`](WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-2026-06-07.md) (369) ·
  [`WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-2026-06-cycles-2-5.md`](WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-2026-06-cycles-2-5.md)
  (the early-June root log, Cycles 2–5 / PRs #712–#807).
  ⚠ **MEASURED 2026-09-29 — THE MONTH-ROLLOVER RULE THIS BULLET USED TO CARRY DID
  NOT WORK.** The 2026-09-03 split took the file from ~400k tokens to ~14k and said
  *"when the month rolls over, archive the closed month"*. Inside that one month it
  grew back to **1.17 MB / 116 entries / ~290k tokens**, and was loaded in full into
  every session, because a rule that fires at a month boundary says nothing about
  the size reached before it. The cap replaced it; the first run moved 106 entries
  (head unchanged, `original entries === kept + moved` byte for byte) and left
  **140 KB / ~35k tokens**.
  ⚠ **An archive is HISTORY, not guidance.** Its conventions are superseded by
  whatever this file says today — never work from them.
  ⚠ **To answer a question about older work, GREP the archives — never `cat` one.**
  They are 700 KB–1 MB each, so reading one whole re-pays the token tax the cap
  removes. `grep -n "<term>" docs/WORKLOG-ARCHIVE-*.md` to find the entry, then
  `sed -n '<start>,<end>p'` to read only that entry.
- **Mobile app** lives in `mobile-app/` (Capacitor/Vite SPA, the `/m/` broadsheet).
  - Build: from `mobile-app/`, `VITE_BASE=/m/ npm run build`.
  - Publish into the website: from the **repo root**, `rm -rf public/m && cp -r mobile-app/dist public/m`.
  - Parse-check a JSX file before building:
    `node -e "require('@babel/parser').parse(require('fs').readFileSync('<file>','utf8'),{sourceType:'module',plugins:['jsx']})"`
- **Website = `public/newdesign/`.** This is the canonical, live website surface
  we build on — **always edit the pages here** (`*.html` + their `*.jsx` babel
  blocks/companions), not anywhere else. Each `*.html` is the live page; many are
  **self-contained** (inline `<script type="text/babel">`) and pull in shared
  `living*.jsx` / `chatWidget.jsx` / `pageShell.jsx` via `?v=N` tags.
  ⚠️ **You do NOT need to bump the `?v=` — that convention is OBSOLETE**
  (superseded 2026-07-16; it predates the #1726 precompile). At deploy,
  `scripts/build-newdesign.mjs` **rewrites every newdesign page's script tags to
  `nd/<name>?v=<content-hash>`**, so production's cache key is the **content
  hash** — editing a `.jsx` busts its cache automatically. The precompile covers
  **all** of `public/newdesign/` (it's the only place `.jsx?v=` refs exist), so
  there is no exception. **Do not sweep `?v=` across a shared jsx's consumers**
  — `pageShell.jsx` has 69, which makes a 70-file PR that **CodeRabbit
  auto-skips (>50 files = no review at all)**. ⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-08-24 — that reason
  retired with CodeRabbit; the advice did not.** A 70-file `?v` sweep is still 69 files of
  churn the deploy already does for you. Keep the PR to the jsx file. (The
  hand-written `?v` only affects the raw-babel dev path — a stale local copy is
  one hard-refresh.) A few legacy `*.jsx` files (e.g. `memberProfile.jsx`) are
  **orphaned/dead** (nothing loads them) — confirm a file is actually referenced
  before relying on an edit there.
  The Next.js app at the repo root (`src/`) is **API routes + the gated
  `/dashboard`** (typecheck: `npx tsc --noEmit`); the public/marketing/profile/
  store/coach pages all live in `public/newdesign/`.
- **Git / deploy:** develop on the session's `claude/*` branch. Per change: commit →
  push → open PR → **wait for the CI checks to go green** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
  Web typecheck+build, Mobile build + public/m sync) → **review the PR diff** →
  squash-merge → re-sync the branch to `main`
  (`git fetch origin main && checkout main && reset --hard origin/main && checkout <branch> && reset --hard origin/main && push --force-with-lease`).
  Don't merge on red — a failed check is exactly the broken-main it exists to stop.
  CI also fails when `public/m` is stale (mobile source edited without republishing).
- **Diff review before merge (standard practice).** For any non-trivial change
  (logic, data flow, theming, anything touching shared components), give the PR
  diff a dedicated review pass before squash-merging — hunting specifically for:
  logic bugs/regressions, theme-token violations (hardcoded ink/paper on themed
  surfaces, theme tokens on fixed-background screens), demo-vs-live data leaks,
  and changes to shared code that other profiles/pages also render. (**No longer
  check for "missed `?v=` bumps"** — that convention is obsolete, see the
  newdesign bullet above; flag a *needless* 69-file `?v` sweep instead, since it
  trips CodeRabbit's 50-file skip — ⚠ **that reason retired with CodeRabbit on
  2026-08-24; the sweep is still needless churn**.) Docs/copy-only tweaks can
  skip it. Riskier changes additionally go to `staging` for a click-through
  before merging.
- ⛔️ **ONE REVIEW TRIGGER PER PR, AND FRONT-LOAD EVERYTHING INTO IT — A ROUND BILLS BY FILE
  COUNT.** Owner, 2026-09-11, after I ran two rounds on #2053: *"make sure it goes into this
  coderabbit review so you don't use more money / Should have done that before running
  coderabbit"*. CodeRabbit charges **$0.25 per reviewed file** beyond the included allowance
  (~1 review/hour), so a 35-file diff is ~$9 **per round** — and the second round on that PR
  re-derived context I already held. Before triggering, put it ALL in the trigger comment: what
  changed and why, the areas you most want attacked, the evidence you already have, and what is
  deliberately out of scope so it is not raised as new. **Then do not trigger again** — reply in
  the existing thread instead. ⚠ **A second round is not free diligence, it is a second bill**,
  and the fix round's own diff can be covered by the same comment if you write it properly the
  first time.
  ⚠ **MEASURED 2026-09-29: FRONT-LOAD THE PR DESCRIPTION, NOT THE TRIGGER COMMENT.** Long trigger
  comments were answered as chat 14 times after the notice, so the round never started, while all
  11 answered `full review` triggers of 221 characters or fewer were read as commands. The
  owner's point stands: one round, with everything in it. Only where the brief goes has changed;
  see the 09-29 banner below.
  ⚠ **AND READ THE HEAD A ROUND COVERS BEFORE ACTING ON IT.** #2053's submitted review carried
  `sourceCommitId = coveredCommitId` = the FIRST head, so three of its six comments described
  code a later commit had already replaced. Acting on them would have redone finished work — and
  re-triggering to "get a clean verdict" would have bought a third bill for nothing.
- **Review stack before shipping (required).** Layers that gate every
  non-trivial change.
  ⚠ **THE REVIEWER SYSTEM — CURRENT AS OF 2026-10-05: CODERABBIT ONLY WHEN THE OWNER ASKS FOR IT ON
  THAT PR.** Owner, 2026-10-05, on #2206, after I carried their *"run coderabbit"* on #2205 over to
  the next PR: *"i didnt ask you to do coderabbit"*. An ask covers the PR it was given on, not the
  next one, so this replaces the 09-21 *one round per PR*. When the owner does ask, the 09-29
  mechanics below still apply: wait for the notice, post the bare trigger, put the brief in the
  description, run one round. Codex fires on its own when a PR opens, and reading what it posts
  needs no ask. The merge gate is unchanged: CI green on the final head, not a draft. Asked since
  then: #2213 and #2215. Not asked: #2210 and #2214.
  ⚠ **THE REVIEWER SYSTEM — CURRENT AS OF 2026-09-29: COPILOT WHEN CODERABBIT DOES NOT ANSWER.**
  Owner, 2026-09-29, on #2179: *"if coderabbit is not wokring run copilot codereview"* and *"dont
  merge if not properly reviewed"*. The 09-21 ruling below still names the first reviewer; this
  names the fallback. Copilot runs on its own on every push (all four of #2179's pushed heads), and
  a requested run is one tool call, `mcp__github__request_copilot_review`. It posts its findings as
  line threads under a COMMENTED overview whose own `commit_id` names the head it read, and it never
  approves. ⚠ **It has a per-account review quota, and a head past it gets no review at all:**
  #2179's `506633f` was declined twice and merged on the owner's *"merge it"*, and #2182 was
  declined the same day. ⚠ **Wait for CodeRabbit's own automatic notice, then post the bare
  command.** Measured 2026-09-29 over all 83 triggers since 09-01: a trigger got no reply only on
  the three PRs whose notice came late or never (#2160 after 122 s, #2179 after 644 s, #2178
  never), and 4 of the 6 posted before a notice were still answered. Separately, 14 review
  triggers posted after the notice were answered as chat, and no review command ran. All 11
  answered `full review` triggers of 221 characters or fewer were read as commands, so put the
  brief in the PR description and keep the trigger to `@coderabbitai full review`. The
  2026-09-29 #2179 changelog entry has the cases. The merge gate is unchanged (CI green on the
  final head, not a draft), and a head without a review is not merged unless the owner says so.
  ⚠ **THE REVIEWER SYSTEM — CURRENT AS OF 2026-09-21. CODERABBIT, FOR NOW.** Owner, 2026-09-21,
  after Codex had refused every trigger of the day on its usage limit (#2126 · #2127 · #2130 ·
  #2131 · #2132 · #2133 · #2134, the one permitted retry included): ***"Use coderabbit for
  now"***. So: **one `@coderabbitai full review` per PR, front-loaded, worked, never re-triggered;
  Codex is not triggered while this stands** (the 2026-09-11 ruling that the two never run
  together is untouched). **The merge gate is unchanged: CI green on the final head AND not a
  draft.** Three mechanics, each measured the day it was ruled: ⚠ **a CLOSED PR cannot be
  reviewed** (*"Action not completed — Pull request is closed"*), so a merged diff gets its round
  on a REVIEW-ONLY reproduction — a head branch at the squash commit over a base branch at its
  parent, so the PR diff IS the merged diff, closed unmerged afterwards (#2133 for #2130, #2134
  for #2126); ⚠ **a base other than `main` / `staging` gets no auto-review**, so on such a PR the
  manual trigger is the whole round; ⚠ **and the round bills by FILE COUNT beyond one included
  review an hour** (*"Your plan provides up to 1 included review per hour; 0 remain after this
  review"*), so a round that can wait for the slot waits for it. ⚠ **MEASURED 2026-09-22 (#2147): PAST THE SLOT
  A TRIGGER IS REFUSED, NOT BILLED, while no seat is assigned.** *"Only developers with an
  assigned seat can use this organization's usage-based review budget"*: the reply reads
  *"Action not completed — Review rate limited"* and nothing runs, so re-trigger once the slot
  reopens. It is not a second round; the first never ran. ⚠ **MEASURED 2026-09-23 (#2155), AS
  ON #2150: A REPLY TO A TRIGGER IS NOT A REVIEW.** A trigger can be answered as chat: the reply
  opens with the *initiate chat* tip and carries no `review command invocation` marker. An
  accepted one can still be refused: #2155's reply said *"Full review triggered"* and was edited
  seconds later to *"Action not completed — Review rate limited"*. So read the reply's marker
  **and** the head's CodeRabbit commit status before waiting on a review. Triggers of 221, 642
  and 942 characters were read as commands; 1,555 and 4,404 were answered as chat. Length fits all
  five, and so does a numbered list: both chat ones had one, and none of the three commands did.
  Neither is proven. ⚠ **MEASURED 2026-09-29 OVER ALL 83 TRIGGERS SINCE 09-01: A LIST DOES NOT
  SEPARATE THEM (23 commands had one), AND LENGTH ONLY DOES AT THE SHORT END** (see the 09-29
  banner above). **The yield on the day it was
  ruled: #2133 (21 files) returned three findings and #2134 (17 files) one — every one real,
  every one fixed in #2135 — including a High that my own adversarial read had missed** (the
  no-key fallback handing the app example coaches with no listing behind them). The round on #2135 itself
  (8 files) returned four more, three real and one refuted — and my own read of that diff, run beside it,
  found the largest defect of the day inside one of the fixes. The 2026-09-11
  rulings below are HISTORY as of this line, kept for their reasoning.
  ⚠ **THE REVIEWER SYSTEM — CURRENT AS OF 2026-09-11 (THIRD AND FINAL RULING OF THE DAY).
  CODEX IS THE ONLY EXTERNAL REVIEWER. CODERABBIT IS OUT.** Owner, 2026-09-11, after the
  fallback had been exercised exactly once: ***"no more coderabbit"***. So: **trigger
  `@codex review` on every PR; when Codex is unavailable there is NO second reviewer** — the
  round is my own adversarial read of the diff plus a mutation round, and the PR says so
  rather than pretending a layer ran.
  ⚠ **RE-CONFIRMED THE SAME EVENING, AFTER I BROKE IT.** On #2045 the owner said *"ok run
  coderabbit"*, believing Codex had not run — they had been reading the summary row pinned to
  the PREVIOUS head, which is the head-pinning trap two paragraphs down. I triggered
  CodeRabbit without first checking that belief against the live row. Seeing both running,
  the owner ruled: ***"i dont want codex and coderabbit both running"*** → **Codex only.** So
  the block above stands, and the lesson is mine: *when an instruction rests on a premise you
  can measure in one call, measure it before you act on it* — the trigger cost a round that
  bought nothing.
  ⚠ **AND THE MEASURED YIELD ON THAT PR IS WHY THE RULING IS EASY.** Across five heads Codex
  returned **9 findings, every one real and every one fixed** — including a defect no other
  layer could have caught, a `font-variation-settings` axis the page set sixteen times and
  never requested, which is invisible to every browser, linter and build because an ignored
  axis is not an error. CodeRabbit's completed round on the same PR returned *"no actionable
  comments"*; its one useful contribution was a merge-conflict notice, which had gone stale by
  the time it was read. **And it bills $0.25/file** — ~$3.50 across this PR — where Codex is
  free. *A second reviewer earns its place on findings, not on breadth.*
  ⚠ **THE REVIEWER SYSTEM — CURRENT AS OF 2026-09-11 (FOURTH RULING OF THE DAY). CODEX ON
  EVERY PR; CODERABBIT WHEN CODEX IS NOT WORKING.** Owner, 2026-09-11, on a head Codex had
  just refused: ***"then run coderabbit if codex is not working"***. So the order is
  **conditional, not exclusive** — trigger `@codex review` first, and when it declines or
  goes silent, trigger `@coderabbitai full review` on that same head rather than shipping
  with no external layer. **The merge gate is untouched: CI green on the final head AND not
  a draft.**
  ⚠ **"NOT WORKING" IS A MEASUREMENT, AND IT HAS THE TWO FACES RECORDED BELOW** — a spoken
  refusal within seconds (*"You have reached your Codex usage limits for code reviews"*) or
  **silence**, no review and no `Running` on your head. Read the Codex summary comment before
  falling back, and **retry once first**: the limit is a rolling window that was measured
  lifting in six minutes on #2042 and in ~11 hours on #2036. Falling back on a stale memory
  of yesterday's refusal skips the reviewer that would have answered.
  ⚠ **THIS RESTORES THE SECOND RULING AND RETIRES THE THIRD**, which read
  ***"no more coderabbit"*** and made Codex the only external reviewer. That is **no longer
  the standing position** — but the reason it existed is worth keeping: the fallback is for
  a head Codex could not review, never a second opinion on one it did. **Four rulings in one
  day**, and the churn is itself the argument for a gate that names only CI: three reviewers
  have moved in and out of this file in three weeks and `/console` has cost nothing for it.
  ⚠ **THREE RULINGS IN ONE DAY, AND THE MIDDLE ONE IS DEAD.** *"if codex is timed out then
  use coderabbit"* (the second) was live for about an hour, was used once on #2040, and is
  **superseded**. Its measurement is worth keeping — the fallback found two real things,
  including an ambiguity in these very conventions — but **do not trigger CodeRabbit on that
  basis.** ⚠ **REVIVED SAME DAY BY THE FOURTH RULING ABOVE — this "DEAD" is itself dead.**
  The middle ruling's conditional shape is the standing one again (*"then run coderabbit if
  codex is not working"*), so **do** trigger CodeRabbit on exactly that basis. Kept with its
  marker rather than deleted, because deleting it would erase the measurement; but read the
  banner, not this. ⚠ And note what the churn cost: a reader landing between the second and third
  rulings would have found a prohibition and its own replacement three lines apart. That is
  the defect CodeRabbit flagged, on the one PR it was brought back for, about this file.
  ⚠ **"TIMED OUT" IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT AN ASSUMPTION — AND IT HAS TWO FACES.** Codex posts a
  **Codex Review Summary** comment naming the head and its status (`Running`, a findings round,
  or a refusal within SECONDS: *"You have reached your Codex usage limits for code reviews."*).
  **Read that comment before concluding it is unavailable**: on #2040 the same trigger that
  was refused twice on #2033 came back **Running** on the first try, so the limit lifts, and a
  session that assumes yesterday's refusal skips the only external reviewer it has.
  ⚠ **AND A SECOND SESSION MEASURED THE SAME LIFT INDEPENDENTLY, ON A DIFFERENT PR.** Owner:
  *"run codex if you can"*. On #2041 it **auto-fired on PR open** and returned a P2 that was
  right (a per-mount preference store clobbering the coach's own document), and a later manual
  `@codex review` on that PR was accepted rather than refused. **Two PRs, two sessions, one
  answer: the refusal was hours old and had lifted.** Trigger it; if it declines, note the
  decline in the PR and move on.
  ⚠ **THE SECOND FACE IS SILENCE, AND IT WAS MEASURED ON #2040 TOO.** After five reviewed
  heads the sixth trigger produced **no review, no `Running`, and no refusal** — fifteen
  minutes of nothing, which is not the shape the spoken limit takes. **Under the final ruling
  there is nothing to fall back TO**, so what this buys is honesty rather than a second
  reviewer: when the summary has not moved to your head, say so in the PR and merge on CI
  green with your own round as the only review, instead of reporting a layer that never ran.
  *A funding state is a claim with a shelf life, and the only honest form of it is the one you
  just measured* — this file's own sentence, now with an operational consequence.
  ⚠ **AND THE MERGE GATE IS STILL CI GREEN ON THE FINAL HEAD AND NOT A DRAFT.** No reviewer
  closes it. The 2026-08-26 post-mortem below is why, and **three rulings in one day** moving
  reviewers in and out is exactly the churn that post-mortem predicts — it cost `/console`
  nothing, because the gate names only CI.
  ⚠ **THE FIRST RULING OF THE DAY, WHOSE CODERABBIT HALF THE THIRD ONE RESTORES.** Owner,
  2026-09-11, earlier: ***"dont run coderabbit moving forward"***, read at the time as *"not
  as a gate, not as a sweep, not once."* **On CodeRabbit that is the standing position again**
  — the conditional ruling that briefly displaced it is itself superseded. ⚠ **What is dead
  is the OTHER half: its conclusion that *both* external reviewers are out.** That rested on a
  measurement — Codex answering an explicit trigger on #2033 and #2037 within seconds with
  *"You have reached your Codex usage limits for code reviews."* — and #2040 refuted it on the
  first try. **Codex is IN and is triggered on every PR.** A session that reads this paragraph
  alone will skip the one external reviewer it has. (The owner has separately ruled the
  `/code-review` skill out: *"that doesnt work and takes too long"*, with the same verdict on
  the Workflow tool.)
  ⚠ **SO THE LAYER BELOW IS MINE, AND UNDER THE FINAL RULING IT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT RUNS
  UNCONDITIONALLY:** **an adversarial read of my own diff before pushing** — hand-run, not a
  skill invocation — hunting the regressions the diff-review bullet below enumerates, plus a
  mutation round proving each new guard can actually fail. Codex runs beside it when it is
  answering; when it is not, this is the whole review, and the PR says so.
  ⚠ **AND READING A VERDICT OFF THE API HAS ONE TRAP WORTH THE LINE.** A Codex **review**
  carries the head it judged in its own `commit_id`, but its **inline comments all report
  the CURRENT head**. Measured on #2036, which took four Codex rounds across four heads
  (`6d50fe6` · `65555ac` · `e49fd22` · `db1d7d9`): the reviews pin correctly, and **every
  one of their inline comments reads `db1d7d9`** — including findings filed against heads
  three pushes earlier. So **pin a verdict on the review, never on its comments**, or a
  stale finding reads as a live one on today's code. The CodeRabbit `APPROVED` on that same
  PR had the mirror problem: pinned to `43575f27`, a pre-rebase commit **not in the merged
  history at all**.
  ⚠ **REGISTERED, NOT SWEPT: `/console` still renders a `CR` chip, and it will read `none`
  forever.** `ConsoleClient.tsx` branches on `p.coderabbit` and `flight/route.ts` still
  computes `coderabbitVerdict`. It is **display, not a gate** — checked rather than assumed:
  `prAllGreen({ ci, draft })` reads no reviewer at all, which is why three reviewers leaving
  in three weeks cost the board nothing this time. Left because removing a chip is a code
  change and this is a records change; named because a chip for a reviewer nobody runs is
  the next reader's false signal.
  ⚠ **A FOURTH DATA POINT FOR THE DAY, DECLARED HERE RATHER THAN RESOLVED: THE OWNER TOLD
  *THIS* SESSION *"run coderabbit"*, AND IT RAN — ON #2043 AND #2045.** Both acknowledged an
  explicit `@coderabbitai full review` within eleven seconds.
  ⚠ **I CANNOT PIN IT AGAINST THE THIRD RULING ABOVE AND WILL NOT PRETEND TO.** *"Record the
  final reviewer ruling"* was pushed at **18:20:12Z**; my triggers went out at **18:30:16Z**
  and **18:32:05Z** — but the instruction reached me somewhere in the ~29-minute window after
  my Codex triggers were refused at 18:01Z, so it may sit either side of 18:20. **The standing
  position is OUT and I stopped**: two of the three recorded rulings say no, and the third
  says *"never trigger it"* in as many words. But the owner said otherwise to a live session,
  which is theirs to settle and not mine to overwrite. *Two sessions can each hold the owner's
  latest word and disagree; the honest move is to record both and stop running the disputed
  one.*
  ⚠ **WHAT THE TWO ROUNDS BOUGHT, kept because the block above says the one-hour fallback's
  measurement was worth keeping.** #2045 came back **clean** — no actionable comments, merge
  risk minimal, 6/6 pre-merge checks including the security review — and flagged the one real
  thing on it: the branch had gone **un-mergeable** while `main` moved under it. Both open PRs
  had, in fact; both are merged up now. #2043's round was still running when this was written
  and **is not being re-triggered whatever it returns**.
  ⚠ **AND THE PRICE IS ON A RECEIPT, WHICH IS WHY THE 2026-08-24 "nothing left to buy" LINE
  BELOW IS RE-CORRECTED WHERE IT SITS.** #2045's round posted a *"Usage-based review
  receipt"*: **Reviewed files: 4 · Charged: $1.00**, at a stated **$0.25/file** beyond the
  plan's included limit, under the Fair Usage Limits Policy, next included review ~20 minutes
  out. So the economy is **dormant by rule, not by funding — a single trigger re-opens it and
  charges** — and note the shape: **a round's price scales with the FILE COUNT**, which makes
  the needless 69-file `?v` sweep this file already calls churn expensive as well as noisy.
  ⚠ **ONE MECHANISM IS WORTH KEEPING WHOEVER IS RUNNING.** A finished CodeRabbit round posts a
  **Merge Risk** line carrying a hidden `final_review_risk_coverage` payload with
  `sourceCommitId` and `coveredCommitId` — on #2045 both read `d63f16ac`, so it **states the
  head it covered** instead of leaving you to infer it. That is the only verdict marker this
  file documents that is head-pinned *by construction*, where `Actionable comments posted: N`
  is edited in place and an APPROVED review can name a commit not in the merged history.
  **A reviewer that declares its own coverage is the shape to ask every reviewer for.**
  ⚠ **THE MERGE GATE IS UNCHANGED, AND THAT IS THE POINT: CI green on the final head AND
  not a draft.** Because no reviewer is named IN the gate, three reviewers leaving in
  three weeks cost `/console` nothing this time — which is the 2026-08-26 post-mortem
  paying off rather than being re-learned. *A rule that names a party who can leave has an
  expiry date nobody wrote down; a gate that names only CI does not.*
  ⚠ **AND THIS IS THE THIRD HANDOVER OF THE SAME SENTENCE.** When Codex went out on
  2026-08-21 this file wrote *"losing Codex loses a real layer, and self-review is what has
  to cover it"*; CodeRabbit then covered it; **CodeRabbit is now out for good, so on any head
  Codex does not answer, self-review covers both.** **The measured yields below are what it
  has to absorb** — Codex found the defects that make a feature *fake*, CodeRabbit found more
  and wider at a higher false rate. Read those paragraphs as a checklist for my own pass, not
  as history about tools.
  ⚠ **THE REVIEWER SYSTEM AS OF 2026-09-10 — NARROWED BY THE 09-11 RULING ABOVE, kept
  because its merge-gate and one-round-per-PR rulings still bind.**
  Owner, 2026-09-10: *"i just want the tasks completed as we said we were with proper
  reviews for each PR"* + *"trigging a codex review on each PR as well moving forward"*.
  **EVERY PR GETS TWO REVIEW LAYERS: `/code-review` before pushing, and an explicit
  `@codex review` comment on the PR.**
  ⚠ **THIS REVERSES THE STANDING "NEVER TRIGGER CODEX" RULING** (owner, 2026-08-21),
  whose stated premise — no credits — measurement had already refuted on 2026-08-29 while
  the ruling itself stood. The owner has now revised it directly, which is theirs to do
  and mine to record HERE rather than in a handoff nobody auto-reads.
  ⚠ **AND ONE ROUND PER PR, NOT A FAN-OUT.** Owner, 2026-09-10, on an 8-dimension ×
  3-refuter review workflow: *"is this overkill?" … "then dont do it"*. The maximal
  adversarial harness is for migrations, money and persistence — not for every diff. Run
  `/code-review` once, work its findings, trigger Codex, merge on CI green.
  ⚠ **THE MERGE GATE ITSELF IS UNCHANGED: CI green on the final head AND not a draft.**
  Codex advises; it does not close the gate — the 2026-08-26 post-mortem below explains
  why naming a reviewer IN the gate has now broken `/console` twice, and that lesson is
  not reopened by this ruling.
  ⚠ **AND CODERABBIT IS OUT — ⚠ NO LONGER TRUE.** This whole paragraph is superseded by the
  **fourth** ruling at the head of this block: CodeRabbit is the fallback again whenever Codex
  is not working, and `@coderabbitai full review` on such a head is what the owner asked for.
  Read the banner. What survives here is only the narrow shape of the permission — it is a
  reviewer for a head Codex could not review, not a second opinion on one it did. **This retires the 2026-08-19 authorisation**
  recorded further down, and everything under it describing how to trigger, re-trigger, pay
  for or read a CodeRabbit verdict is HISTORY — kept only for the two rules that were never
  about CodeRabbit (*a verdict is only about the head it names*, *the absence of a record is
  never a pass*). ⚠ The layer list in this paragraph's last sentence read *"`/code-review` and
  the Codex trigger"*; **`/code-review` is out too** (owner: *"that doesnt work and takes too
  long"*), so the layers are **my own adversarial pass and the Codex trigger**. The merge gate
  is unchanged.
  ⚠ **AND AS OF 2026-09-11 CODEX IS REFUSING: *"You have reached your Codex usage limits for
  code reviews."*** Measured on #2033, twice — the bot answers that within seconds of an
  `@codex review` comment, on two different heads. **This does not reverse the owner's
  ruling and does not change the gate.** Trigger it as the ruling says; a refusal is the
  layer being unavailable, not skipped, and it is **noted in the PR rather than waited
  on**. ⚠ **CORRECTED LATER THE SAME DAY — the refusal did NOT hold.** On #2040 the same
  trigger came back `Running` on the first try and Codex reviewed five consecutive heads.
  **So do not read this paragraph as a standing state**; it is one measurement, and the
  head of this block carries the current one. ⚠ Read it against the 2026-08-29 correction
  further down, which refuted *"the account has no credits"* with three measured
  auto-reviews — **each of these was true on its own date**, which is the whole lesson: *a
  funding state is a claim with a shelf life, and the only honest form of it is the one you
  just measured.*
  ⚠ **EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE THAT NAMES A GATING REVIEWER IS HISTORY, KEPT ON
  PURPOSE.** It is not deleted, because two of its rules turned out to be about reviewers
  in general rather than about CodeRabbit: **a verdict is only about the head it names**,
  and **the absence of a record is never a pass**. Each superseded claim carries its own
  ⚠ CORRECTED marker — if you find one that does not, the marker is missing, not the
  claim revived.
  ⚠ **AND THE RETIREMENT HAD A CODE CONSEQUENCE NOBODY NOTICED FOR TWO DAYS.**
  `prAllGreen` required a *named* reviewer's pass, so a retired reviewer's permanent
  `none` closed the gate on every green PR: `/console` reported **every PR as
  not-mergeable regardless of CI**, 2026-08-24 → 2026-08-26. **This was the SECOND time
  in four days** — the same defect shipped with Codex in #1914 and again with CodeRabbit
  in #1916. Fixed 2026-08-26 by removing reviewers from the gate's inputs *and from its
  TYPE* (#1930 → eec328a55), so re-wiring one fails to compile. **When a rule names a
  party who can leave, it
  has an expiry date nobody wrote down.**
  ⚠ **THE REVIEWER SYSTEM AS OF 2026-08-21 — SUPERSEDED BY THE BANNER ABOVE, kept for
  its reasoning.** Owner,
  2026-08-21: *"no more codex, out of credits, only coderabbit"*. Read this before the
  layers below, several of which describe superseded systems and are kept only for their
  history:
  **(a) own adversarial self-review** before the first push — still the layer that
  catches the most, and now the ONLY one that runs before a reviewer sees the diff;
  **(b) CodeRabbit — THE GATE, re-triggered EVERY round** — `@coderabbitai full review`
  on each head you believe final, findings worked, false ones refuted with evidence.
  **There is no second reviewer.**
  ⚠ **CODEX IS OUT — THE ACCOUNT HAS NO CREDITS.** Never trigger it, never wait on it,
  never gate on it. It may still auto-fire on PR open, and a finding it has **already
  posted** is free to read — two such were real defects on 2026-08-21 — because reading a
  record is not running a reviewer.
  ⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-08-29 — THE OPERATIONAL RULE STANDS; ITS STATED PREMISE DOES NOT.**
  Codex is **funded and auto-reviewing this repo**, measured: three full reviews in ~70
  minutes, each naming the head it read (#1946 `88481a8a07` 21:32Z and `dc33e44d72`
  21:51Z; #1947 `0403bc9b6b` 22:44Z). The #1947 one is decisive because it fired with **no
  trigger** — its own summary comment records the **Review trigger** as literally
  **`PR opened`**. So "the account has no credits" is refuted; **"never trigger it"
  remains the owner's ruling** and is untouched here. A ruling whose stated reason turns
  out false is still the owner's to revise — this file's own doctrine, and the exact trap
  it post-mortems twice (#1914, #1916) is a rule rewritten by whoever noticed it was
  awkward.
  ⚠ **AND THE PREMISE IS LOAD-BEARING, WHICH IS WHY IT IS CORRECTED RATHER THAN LEFT.**
  On #1947's `0403bc9b6b` the two reviewers split cleanly. **Codex: 2 findings, both
  real** — the wrong-scroller bug, and **native back not stepping through a station**,
  which *nothing else caught* (not CodeRabbit, not my pre-push self-review, not a
  7-dimension adversarial pass). **CodeRabbit: 3 findings, 1 real, 2 refutable** —
  `weekTargets` cannot be empty, and `public/m` is gitignored with zero tracked files
  (its own script printed *"no public/m changes in this PR"* and then reported that
  absence as the defect). The house runs **one** reviewer by ruling; on that head the
  retired one had the better yield. **Registered as an OWNER RULING NEEDED, not acted on.**
  ⚠ **DISCLOSURE — I BROKE THIS RULE ON #1946.** I posted `@codex review`, an explicit
  trigger, which the rule forbids in as many words. Two aggravating details, both mine:
  it was **unnecessary as well as forbidden** (Codex had already auto-reviewed
  `88481a8a07` at 21:32, before my trigger), and **I had read the rule** — I judged the
  premise stale and acted on my own judgement instead of raising it, which is precisely
  the move this file's own "naming a reviewer at all" post-mortems warn about. On #1947
  I did **not** trigger it; it auto-fired, and reading an already-posted record is what
  the rule expressly allows. That is the compliant shape.
  ⚠ **Two earlier rules are DEAD and will read as live if you skim:** *"CodeRabbit ONCE
  as a breadth sweep, Codex the gate"* (2026-08-20) and *"Codex gets ONE round after
  CodeRabbit clears"* (2026-08-21, superseded the same day it was written).
  ⚠ **Never compare severity labels across reviewers**: CodeRabbit's "Major" and Codex's
  "P1" are self-assigned on different scales; report each in its own terms, never sum them.
  **What the measurement said while both ran, because it says what layer (a) now has to
  absorb:** Codex found the bugs that make a feature *fake* (its P1s here included a
  scheduler computed, displayed, and ignored by the code that runs the cook); CodeRabbit
  finds more, wider, and noisier (2 of its last 5 on #1910 were refutable), and it found
  **27 findings on a tree Codex had already reviewed across eight rounds**, including two
  real defects Codex missed. They were complementary, not redundant — so losing Codex
  loses a real layer, and self-review is what has to cover it.

  The layers, in order, for any
  non-trivial change: **(0) CodeRabbit IDE — pre-push.** ⚠ **RETIRED 2026-09-11 with the
  GitHub app — the ruling is *"dont run coderabbit"*, not *"don't run it on GitHub"*, and
  this is the same engine one step earlier. History from here.** The CodeRabbit VS Code
  extension (`coderabbit.coderabbit-vscode`, installed locally; sign in to its
  sidebar panel once) reviews the LOCAL diff in-editor **before** pushing, so the
  obvious stuff is fixed before a PR exists. It's **opportunistic, not a hard
  gate** — run it on non-trivial/risky diffs to save PR round-trips, skip it on
  one-liners. Same engine as layer 2, just earlier + with less context; there's no
  CLI, so it's editor-triggered (the agent can't invoke it). **(1) `/code-review`**
  — run the skill on the diff before merging (Claude reviews for logic bugs + the
  regressions listed above); **(2) CodeRabbit GitHub App.** ⚠ **RETIRED 2026-09-11 — see
  the ruling at the head of this stack. Everything to the end of layer (2) is HISTORY, and
  what survives it is not about CodeRabbit: a verdict is only about the head it names, the
  absence of a record is never a pass, and a notice naming a number is not a refusal.**
  ⚠ **CORRECTED
  2026-08-18 — this read "the AUTHORITATIVE review · auto-reviews every PR", and
  BOTH halves are now false.** It reviews on request only — its own comment says
  *"Reviews should be triggered manually for repositories with fewer than 10
  stars"* — and it reviewed **neither** PR that day. A review layer disappeared
  silently while this paragraph still promised it. ⚠ **CORRECTED AGAIN 2026-08-20 — THE OWNER AUTHORISED IT ON 2026-08-19.**
  This paragraph read *"DO NOT TRIGGER IT — the owner's standing rule is that
  CodeRabbit is not part of this workflow"*, and that is **no longer true**: the
  owner asked for it directly. Triggering it by hand is now **allowed**. (The
  2026-08-18 hand-trigger predated the authorisation and was a rule break at the
  time; it is no longer the rule being broken.)
  ⚠ **RECORDS-ONLY DIFFS GET NO REVIEW ROUND — owner, 2026-08-21:** *"i also dont understand
  the constant back and forth reviews on record updates"*. A diff touching only `docs/**` and
  war-room label text **merges on CI green**, full stop. The gate below keeps its full force
  on anything that ships code. **Why, measured:** #1918 was records-only and took FOUR rounds
  — 3 → 1 → 3 → 2 findings — producing a hyphen, several wording notes, one stale count and
  one repo-settings observation. That curve is **flat**, and English wording has no ground
  truth for a reviewer to be right about, so a language-model reviewer aimed at prose **cannot
  converge**. It is not free either: the included allowance is ~1 review/hour and the rest
  bills the owner.
  ⚠ **CODERABBIT IS THE GATING REVIEWER — owner, 2026-08-20 — AND CODEX IS OUT
  ENTIRELY: never triggered, never waited on, out of credits (owner, 2026-08-21).**
  ⚠ **The "out of credits" half is REFUTED — see the 2026-08-29 correction at the head of
  this stack. Codex is funded and auto-fires on PR open; "never trigger it" still stands
  as the owner's ruling.** It may
  still auto-fire on PR open, `codexVerdict` still runs and `/console` still renders its
  chip — it just decides nothing, and nothing in the merge path reads it. The merge gate is CI green **and a CodeRabbit pass on the final head**.
  ⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-08-24 — CodeRabbit is out too, so this sentence no longer
  describes the gate: it is CI green on the final head AND not a draft.** What survives
  it is the reading rule underneath — a pass must be pinned to the head it judged.
  A pass is an **APPROVED review on that head**, or a zero-marker comment naming it —
  measured across the last 18 merged PRs, approval is the only signal CodeRabbit emits
  reliably on a clean head. ⚠ **`Actionable comments posted: N` is NOT head-pinned**:
  that summary is edited in place, and #1915 merged with it still reading 2 while the
  head review was APPROVED with zero inline findings. Reading it as a verdict on the
  head is how a stale sweep, or a rate-limit notice, gets mistaken for a pass.
  ⚠ **CODERABBIT NEVER AUTO-REVIEWS THIS REPO** — it posts a skip-review comment saying the
  repository *"does not receive automatic reviews because it has fewer than 10 stars"*
  (measured 2026-08-21 on #1916 and #1917, both of which sat unreviewed while CI went
  green). **Every round needs an explicit `@coderabbitai full review`, including the
  first.** An untriggered head reads `none` and is blocked — correctly. **Waiting is never
  the recovery; triggering is.**
  ⚠ **BUT A TRIGGER NOW COSTS SOMETHING, because it is the only reviewer.** The included
  allowance runs at roughly **one review per hour** (*"Your plan provides up to 1 included
  review per hour; 0 remain after this review"*, #1918); past that a trigger bills the
  owner's plan. So **batch every fix into ONE push per round** — the long-standing rule,
  now with a price attached — and when the allowance is spent and nothing is blocked, wait
  out the hour instead of buying a round. ⚠ That notice is **not** a cap: three reviews
  landed on #1918 after the first one. A notice naming a number is not a refusal, and a
  real cap says something else (`rate limited by coderabbit.ai` / `Review limit reached`).
  ⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-08-24 — THE ECONOMY ABOVE IS MOOT: there is nothing left to buy.**
  ⚠ **RE-CORRECTED 2026-09-11 — "nothing left to buy" IS FALSE, MEASURED THE ONE TIME IT WAS
  RUN.** #2045's round returned a usage-based receipt: **4 files, $1.00, at $0.25/file**
  beyond the included limit, next included review ~20 minutes out. CodeRabbit is retired
  again by the day's third ruling, so read the paragraph above as **what a round costs if
  anyone triggers one**, not as history. *A funding state is a claim with a shelf life, and
  this one outlived three rulings in a single day.*

  Kept because the rule it produced outlived its subject — **batch every fix into ONE push
  per round** — which is now about not publishing half-finished heads rather than about a
  bill. ⚠ And the distinction it drew generalises to any metered service: **a notice
  naming a number is not a refusal.**
  ⚠ **Earlier entries in this file say the gate is Codex** — resolved by this line; the
  contradiction they describe (head-pinning vs a ONE-sweep process) dissolved when
  CodeRabbit began being re-triggered every round. **(3)
  required checks** — `main` branch protection requires ALL THREE CI checks
  (`Web (typecheck + build)` + `Mobile (build + public/m sync)` +
  `Secret scan (gitleaks)`) green before a merge (GitHub → Settings →
  Branches; once on, merging on red is impossible). Docs/config-only commits
  may skip layers 0-1. **"Done" detection (rewritten 2026-08-20):** the merge
  gate is **CI green on the final head AND a CodeRabbit pass on the final head** —
  **absence of findings is not a pass**, and neither is a `commented` verdict.
  ⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-08-24 — "done" is now CI green on the final head AND not a
  draft.** The two principles under it are why this is corrected and not cut: **absence of
  a record is never a pass**, and **a verdict is only about the head it names**. Both
  outlive any particular reviewer.
  ⚠ `commented` does **not** mean the head was never looked at — it means **there is no
  SETTLED verdict on this head yet**: either CodeRabbit has spoken only on earlier heads,
  or the only records here are unsettled `COMMENTED` containers, which it also posts when
  it replies to a thread. Re-trigger, or wait out a review already running.
  ⚠ It never conceals findings — head-pinned inline comments are read first and return
  `changes`.
  ⚠ This previously read "after pushing fixes for a CodeRabbit round, WAIT for
  its re-review before merging" — **deleted**: a reviewer that never runs cannot
  supply a merge condition. (⚠ The trailing clause *"and never waiting on
  CodeRabbit is the standing rule"* is itself now stale — see the authorisation
  correction above. You **may** wait on CodeRabbit; it just does not close the gate.)
  ⚠ **THIS READ "RESOLVED 2026-08-20 — `prAllGreen` is CI green AND a clean CODEX
  verdict on THIS head". That shipped in #1914 and was REPLACED THE NEXT DAY by #1916:**
  the gate is CI green **AND a CodeRabbit `approved`-or-`clean` verdict on THIS head**
  AND not a draft. Codex keeps its chip and decides nothing.
  ⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-08-26 — AND THIS PARAGRAPH IS WHERE THE DEFECT LIVED.** Read its
  two sentences in sequence: #1914 pinned the gate to **CODEX** days before Codex was
  retired; #1916 repinned it to **CODERABBIT** three days before CodeRabbit was retired.
  Each rewrite corrected the previous reviewer's *name* and faithfully re-created the
  trap, because the trap is **naming a reviewer at all** — a retired one's verdict pins at
  `none` forever, and `none` is the blocking case. `/console` called every PR
  not-mergeable regardless of CI from 2026-08-24 to 2026-08-26. Fixed by removing both
  reviewers from `prAllGreen`'s inputs **and from its TYPE**, so a caller that re-wires one
  fails to compile instead of silently closing the gate a third time.
  - **Why it had to change, and not just be documented:** `coderabbitVerdict` is
    head-pinned, so the ratified *"CodeRabbit ONCE"* sweep **stops counting the moment
    you push a fix for its own findings** — after which the old gate could never open
    without a re-review the process forbids. The two rules were **unsatisfiable
    together**, not merely different. Codex raised it independently on #1912.
  - ⚠ **The 2026-07-27 ruling rested on a premise measurement refutes.** It made
    `codexPresent` presence-not-freshness because *"Codex leaves no record at all when
    it is clean"*. Across **every** PR from #1840 (2026-07-26) through #1912, every
    clean Codex verdict posts an issue comment carrying `Reviewed commit: <sha>`, and
    **no** trigger comment carries a thumbs-up. #1846, opened **on the ruling's own
    date**, has two such comments. `codexVerdict` reads that field.
  - ⚠ **The change is STRICTER, not looser**, and the strictness was backwards before:
    the reviewer the house calls THE GATE was satisfied by any record the PR ever had,
    while the one it calls "not a gate" blocked on the head. Verified on the live
    corpus rather than fixtures — replaying real GitHub records through the shipped
    function returns **clean** for six PRs and **stale** for #1910 and #1911.
  ⚠ **Worked example, #1910 (2026-08-20), now the regression case.** It merged with CI
  green and CodeRabbit clean on the final head, while **Codex last reviewed
  `f5d2ef80c`** — one of **nine** Codex reviews on that PR, *every one a findings
  round*, and **none on its final head**. Under the old `prAllGreen` that was green.
  Under the new one it is **stale**, and the board asks for a re-trigger. ⚠ I first
  recorded this as a rule break by me; **that was wrong, and the over-correction was
  worth as much attention as the original error** — the defect was in the gate, not in
  the merge.
- **CI checks on every PR (current set).** What runs on a PR into `main`:
  - **`ci.yml`** (every PR + push to `main`/`staging`) — **Web (typecheck +
    build)**, **Mobile (build + public/m sync)**, and **Secret scan (gitleaks)**
    (added #1342 — scans the working tree against `.gitleaks.toml`).
    ⚠ **ALL THREE are REQUIRED checks on `main`** — gitleaks included (the
    "advisory" claim went stale; proven 2026-07-19 when a merge 405'd with
    "Required status check Secret scan (gitleaks) is in progress"). A merge
    attempt while any of the three runs is rejected — wait them out.
  - **`android-build.yml`** (only when `mobile-app/**` changes) — **Build debug
    APK** (debug-signed, no secrets). A **release APK** job is opt-in and runs
    only once the `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*` repo secrets are added.
  - **Vercel** — preview deploy + **Vercel Agent Review** (AI, non-blocking,
    reports `neutral`) + Preview Comments.
  - **CodeRabbit** — ⚠ **RETIRED 2026-09-11 (owner: *"dont run coderabbit moving
    forward"*). Still INSTALLED, so it still posts its own skip-review notice when a PR
    opens; that notice is not a review and nothing in the merge path reads it. History
    below.**
    ⚠ **AND IT STILL ANSWERS AND BILLS ON AN EXPLICIT TRIGGER — measured 2026-09-11 on #2043
    and #2045, which acknowledged within eleven seconds and returned a $1.00 receipt. So the
    retirement is a RULE, not a capability: nothing in the repo enforces it, and the
    operative words are now *"no more coderabbit"* (the day's third ruling), not the one
    quoted here.**
 — **does not run BY ITSELF** (auto-skip notice, <10 stars →
    request-only), but ⚠ **it runs on request and the owner authorised that on
    2026-08-19**; `.coderabbit.yaml` is live config, not dormant. It reviewed
    #1910 across **five** rounds (27 → 6 → 5 → 3 → 0 findings — five results, and the
    changelog and handoff both say five; this line said four).
    ⚠ **THIS READ "SETTLED 2026-08-20 — IT DOES NOT GATE". IT GATES**, since #1916
    (2026-08-21). It was unsettled because
    `coderabbitVerdict` is *head-pinned*: it counts only reviews whose `commit_id` IS
    the head, so a sweep whose findings you then fixed stopped counting the moment you
    pushed the fix, and `prAllGreen` could not then go green without a re-review the
    process then forbade. **"CodeRabbit ONCE" and the old gate were unsatisfiable
    together** — and that contradiction **dissolved** rather than being overridden: with
    CodeRabbit re-triggered every round, head-pinning is exactly what a gate wants.
    ⚠ Reading its verdict: a clean pass leaves **no review** — it leaves a summary
    *comment* carrying `Actionable comments posted: 0`, which is the marker
    `coderabbitVerdict` matches. Read that comment rather than inferring a pass from
    silence, and note a rate-limit notice is **not** a pass (`CR_LIMIT_RE` is checked
    first and deliberately dominates a zero-marker in the same body).
- **Test branch = `staging`** (long-lived, Vercel preview). Pushing any commit to
  `staging` auto-deploys to the stable preview URL
  **https://shape-app-git-staging-cperry8800-droids-projects.vercel.app** — production
  (`theshapecommunity.com`) is untouched. Use it for riskier changes you want to
  click through before merging: `git push origin <branch-or-sha>:staging --force`
  (it's a scratch pointer — force-resetting it is fine; merging to main still goes
  through the normal PR flow). Every dev-branch push also gets its own preview at
  `shape-app-git-claude-<branch>-….vercel.app`. **Caveats:** previews share the
  PRODUCTION Supabase DB + env vars (no isolated test data; don't test destructive
  migrations here — though **Supabase branch DBs are now available** (org upgraded to
  Pro 2026-06-23), so a branch can run against an isolated branch DB if set up), and
  if a preview URL asks you to log in, that's Vercel Deployment Protection
  (Project Settings → Deployment Protection to relax it).
- **Verify before committing:** parse-check changed JS, `tsc --noEmit` for TS, build, copy `public/m`.
  This is now **automated** by a tracked **pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`
  → `scripts/verify-staged.sh`): on `git commit` it runs only the checks the *staged*
  change can break (JSX parse-check · `tsc --noEmit` · mobile build + `public/m` diff ·
  `npm test`), skips docs/config-only commits, and **blocks the commit on failure**.
  Bypass once with `SKIP_VERIFY=1 git commit …`. It's armed via `git config
  core.hooksPath .githooks` — web sessions re-arm it + install deps automatically via
  the **SessionStart hook** (`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`, registered in
  `.claude/settings.json`); **on your own machine run `git config core.hooksPath
  .githooks` once** to enable it locally. CI (`ci.yml`) still runs the full builds on
  PRs into `main` / pushes to `main`+`staging` as the hard gate.
  ⚠ **SMALL COMMITS SKIP IT — owner, 2026-10-06:** *"skip pre commit test for small
  commits"*. The hook's `npm test` is ~4 minutes, and the owner stopped an amend that
  was waiting on it for a one-line change. Commit a small change with `SKIP_VERIFY=1`
  after running the tests it can touch, and say in the PR what ran instead. CI still
  runs everything on the PR.
- **Mutation rounds use ONE runner — never a throwaway script:**
  `node scripts/mutate.mjs --spec tests/mutations/<subject>.mutations.mjs --fail-on-skipped`. Every
  defect the ad-hoc runners shipped (a restore outside a `finally`, an already-mutated
  file snapshotted as the baseline, an anchor silently relocated to a nearby match, a
  verdict read off a pipeline's exit status) is a rule the runner enforces and
  `tests/mutate-runner.test.mjs` drives. Check the spec in beside the PR and paste its
  summary line; a survivor is a guard gap (fix the test) or a proven no-op (mark it
  `expectSurvive` with the proof in the spec). A skip is a mutation that could not be
  applied, most often an anchor that no longer occurs exactly once, so it never ran;
  `--fail-on-skipped` makes any skip exit 1 (#2198).

## Architecture map (mobile broadsheet)

- `mobile-app/src/broadsheet/iosAppBroadsheetClient.jsx` — client app (home, eat,
  train, logger, chat, settings). Biggest file — **~38k lines, measured 2026-09-30**
  (the "~9.7k" this line carried was fourteen months stale). It shrinks one feature
  at a time: when a PR already touches a self-contained screen, carve it out as a
  real ES import. `BSIntegrationsPage.jsx` (2026-09-30, −459 lines) is the pattern
  and `tests/integrations-page-module.test.mjs` pins its rules — every window global
  read **at call time inside the component** (a static import evaluates before the
  client module's body has exposed anything, so a top-level read is React #130), its
  own `useShapeTr()` copy (the i18n ratchet only recognises a translator bound that
  way), no import back into the client module, and the client module keeps
  re-exposing on `window` whatever the pros module reads there.
  - `BSLogMealFlow` — the meal logger (Adjust / Photo / Search / Voice tabs +
    ingredient editor). Delivers a note/memo/photo via `sendMealNote()`.
  - `BSClientEat` — eat/calendar page (meals, swap, grocery views).
  - `BSChatThread` / `BSClientFeed` — shared chat (coaches + clients use the same code).
- `iosAppBroadsheetPros.jsx` — trainer & nutritionist apps (`BSProMe`, console).
- `iosAppBroadsheet.jsx` — shared chrome (`BSPage`, `BSFooter`, `BSSwapSheet`).
- `iosAppBroadsheetRadio.jsx` — Shape Radio (`BSNowPlaying`).
- `mobile-app/src/services/shapeBackend.js` — Supabase data layer (`conversationToThread`, etc.).
- **Theme:** `useBS()` → `t`. Teal accent literal: `t.isLight ? '#0a8f87' : '#34d6c5'`.
  Role colors: nutritionist gold `#a07a2e`, trainer rust `#c0533b`.
- **Window-globals load order:** modules expose components via
  `Object.assign(window, {...})` and consume them via top-level
  `const {...} = window`. If a role module reads a global before a feature module
  defines it, you get React error #130 (undefined component). The shell loaders in
  `iosAppBroadsheetMain.jsx` load feature modules *first*, then the role module;
  pros reuse client-module globals (e.g. `BSClientChat`) off `window`.
- **Sheets** must `createPortal` into `#bs-phone-surface` (position:absolute) so they
  don't overhang the phone frame in desktop preview.

## Backend touchpoints

- `src/app/api/nutrition/meal-note/route.ts` — delivers a meal log's note + voice
  memo + photo to every linked coach. Uploads to the private `meal-notes` storage
  bucket (audio + image mime types); links ride in `messages.metadata.audio/photo`.
- `src/app/api/nutrition/voice/route.ts` — Whisper transcription (returns `{ transcript }`).
- Storage bucket: `supabase-migrations/2026-06-03-meal-notes-bucket.sql` (idempotent;
  re-run after widening mime types). **War Room** (`/warroom`, `src/lib/warroom.ts`) is
  the go-live status board — register new routes in `RAW_ROUTES` and add checklist items there.

## Open work

⚠ **UNAUDITED — carried verbatim from the pre-split log, where these two sections
sat at line 20,631 of a 20,657-line file (i.e. nobody ever read them).** Relocated
2026-09-03 by the archive split; the wording is untouched, so treat every item as
last-reviewed **2026-06** and re-check it against the changelog before acting —
several are marked SHIPPED in their own text.

### Next up (planned)
- **Night-before prep reminders — SHIPPED 2026-10-05 as [#2202](https://github.com/cperry8800-droid/shape-app/pull/2202); Phase 2 is next.**
  The owner took the review's suggestions (https://claude.ai/artifact/VeUyVhgjsuBDqm8v6XstYE): a 7 pm reminder in the member's zone,
  a *Tonight · for tomorrow* card on Eat, and a finish screen that records the prep; the changelog entry has the detail. Phase 2,
  not started: a nutritionist's *"prep the night before"* tick on any meal, a reminder time the member chooses, members planning
  tomorrow's meals, and a morning swap. Push delivery is unproven (0 push devices in production).
- **Nora as the account-setup assistant — owner, 2026-09-29, deferred on their word. PARTLY SHIPPED 2026-10-08 (#2258, #2259):** she answers questions on sign-up, the coach application and the app's paywall and sign-in, and fills the form in with the person; she does not set the account up. The rest of this item is open. *"I also want
  to make Nora pop up when you are going through creating an account, that can fill evreything out
  for you, regading application etc. and also setup your account for you. Maybe save this for the
  next task, right now we can focus on Nora and shape radio"*. Nora appears during sign-up and the
  coach application, fills the forms from a conversation, and sets the account up. Not scoped yet;
  the current Nora work is [`REVIEW-2026-09-29-nora-dj.md`](REVIEW-2026-09-29-nora-dj.md).
- **Nora as a DJ on Shape Radio — reviewed and planned 2026-09-29.**
  [`REVIEW-2026-09-29-nora-dj.md`](REVIEW-2026-09-29-nora-dj.md): what she is today, the booth
  prototype, a five-phase plan (the booth · following what is actually playing · provider
  precision · performance · interactivity) and ten owner rulings. Phase 1 is the booth; Phase 2
  onward goes live only once a real station provider is signed. The prototype source is in
  [`prototypes/nora-booth/`](../prototypes/nora-booth/README.md), and the next step (the owner's
  *"how do we improve the graphics?"*) is planned in [`HANDOFF-2026-09-29.md`](HANDOFF-2026-09-29.md);
  the latest state is [`HANDOFF-2026-09-30.md`](HANDOFF-2026-09-30.md). Merged as
  [#2189](https://github.com/cperry8800-droid/shape-app/pull/2189) on 2026-09-30; the preview is
  version 6.
- **Shape Radio page redesign — the owner picked D · The Signal Field (2026-09-14); THE NEXT BUILD.**
  Code-level brief: [`BUILD-2026-09-14-radio-signal-field.md`](BUILD-2026-09-14-radio-signal-field.md)
  — four PRs, every line reference verified against `main` = `2d49f60`; read it before touching the
  code. The review + board: [`REVIEW-2026-09-14-radio-page.md`](REVIEW-2026-09-14-radio-page.md). The
  shipped masthead stays byte-for-byte (owner ruling, same day); the four §6 rulings are defaulted in
  the brief's §12 and each is reversible without a re-plan.
- **The Wall in the app — owner go-ahead 2026-09-10 (*"yes lets implement the new chat/wall look
  on app"*); THE CURRENT BUILD. The website update is ON HOLD (owner, same day).** Promote
  the PR Wall from a chat channel to a surface: a public definer read over `pr_wall_posts` +
  `post_id` + reactions (one migration), a fifth Chat segment (Feed · **Wall** · Team · Channels ·
  Support) rendering the feed's own `BSActivityCard` inside a `BSPlate` record frame, *Your best*
  + *Post a PR*, a Home card; a coach's reaction on a client's plate is already the Stamp.
  Preview: the board's W tab; spec: `REVIEW-2026-09-10-index-page.md` §7; **code-level build
  brief: [`BUILD-2026-09-10-wall-in-app.md`](BUILD-2026-09-10-wall-in-app.md)** — read it before
  touching the code; every line reference in it was verified against `main` = `7d23eb8`.
- **Design-system pass — Phase 1 SHIPPED 2026-06-11** (`BSPlate` shared
  primitive in the chrome, window-exposed; AgendaCard + weekly-totals tiles
  refactored onto it; converted: Train hero, coach-adjust banner, home
  coach-feed pushed items, find-a-coach bars, Score composite hero). Kept
  quiet BY THE RULE: Eat hero (deliberately condensed strip), Eat/Train list
  rows, Store catalog rows. **Phase 2 SHIPPED same day** — coach apps (both
  roles, role-accented): client-profile StatCards + big attendance/adherence
  metric card (plate w/ tick) + Manage assign card; Plans-tab TOP feature
  cards + AI-generate CTAs squared with role spines. Coach Today lead stays
  typographic (masthead style); rosters/forms/action pages quiet by the rule.
  Two-tier rule: plates = live/actionable; quiet rounded cards =
  forms/sheets/lists; chat bubbles stay round.
- **Client "Library" — save coach content to your profile** (NEW · priority):
  let clients save to their own profile/library: trainers' **workouts** and **paid
  plans/programs** (purchasable — needs the sell/checkout flow), and nutritionists'
  **meals & meal plans**. Needs: a saved-library data model + a client Library screen,
  "Save" actions on coach/marketplace content, and the trainer "sell a plan" purchase path.
- **Marketplace follow-ups**: remove now-dead marketplace constants + `ListingRow`
  (unused after the rebuild); confirm pricing semantics (cards show `$rate/mo`).
  (Coach detail pages are now redesigned — see changelog.)

### Known stubs / next
- Native mic + camera plugins for the iOS App Store build (WebView fallback today;
  iOS barcode SCANNING also rides this — WebKit has no BarcodeDetector, so iOS uses
  the manual barcode entry until a native scanner plugin lands).
- On-device "Shape reads macros" from a meal photo (currently photo → coach review only).
